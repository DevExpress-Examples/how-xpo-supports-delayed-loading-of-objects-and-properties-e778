# How XPO supports delayed loading of objects and properties


<p>This example shows how to define a property with delayed loading. This technique is useful for heavyweight and/or rarely used properties, such as images or large memos. Please refer to the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/A2619">How does XPO support the delayed loading of objects and properties?</a> article to learn implementation details. The example uses the Northwind demo database on a local SQL Server.</p>
